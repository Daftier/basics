This is my first official repository.
I'm currently learning the basics of Python and decided to file all my practice, notes and projects on here.
I'm still in the process of learning about Git and Github and I have a limited idea of what I'm doing.
I really want to learn, grow, explore, and come back and laugh at this 5 years in the future.
Adios.
